  <h3 class="sub-headings">URSZULA PARUCH</h3>
  <p class="text-center"> Hi, my name is Urszula Paruch. I am 35 years old and currently  front end developer based in Krakow Poland. I am a short, slim person who loves sports.  In general, I am a small creature with a lot of energy and enthusiasm for life. A sincere smile appears on my face every day.
My curious personality allowed myself  to try a coding bootcamp, so I enrolled in a front-end development workshop called SheCodes. I am an independent person who loves my own company. I try to overcome all obstacles standing in the way of my goal. I am happy to help others who need support. I can cope well in difficult situations that require a cold blood. I can understand human misery and keep my spirits up, I am understanding and protective. I am often sensitive and have a sense of duty. I try to be optimistic about the world, but it is not always bright. Like all of us, I have a moment of misery and helplessness. I can impose strict discipline on myself, but sometimes I lack strong will and enthusiasm for work. I do not like criticism, but I eagerly listen to praise for myself because it gives me a lot of satisfaction and joy. I am involved in every task entrusted to me and I try to do my best. I am tolerant and loyal to my friends and strangers. Kind to friends and wishing for the happiness of others. I can learn from my own life mistakes. I have my own opinion and I appreciate the people who have it. I can enjoy the moment. I hate hypocrisy, makeshift and mediocrity. I love having a good time and I'm embellished with a good dose of humor.
My interests are related to photography and IT. I am also interested in the kitchen. In my free time, I work on my figure and external appearance.
I believe that I am a liked person because I encounter many gestures of sympathy which I try to reciprocate.
